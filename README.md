# MPP-Exam-Prep
 Fullstack application created to revise for the SDI/MPP Exam

 More funky details will come later as the pain ensues kekw


## Basic Information
 The following represents a simple Writer-Posts application.
 
 Users can login and create posts, which can be viewed by other users if public.
 Anonymous users can only view posts, but cannot create them.
 Moderators can manage (edit/delete) all posts, public and private.
 Admins can manage all users and posts.

 The application is built using the following technologies:
    - PostgreSQL
    - Express
    - Angular.js
    - Node.js

If possible, I will eventually add a User Chat functionality using websockets, as well as AI generated posts using GPT-3. (no promises tho XOXO)
